# GreenMode: Energy-Aware Task Scheduler (v0.1)
Overview
GreenMode is an experimental energy-aware task scheduling system designed to explore how software systems can reduce unnecessary energy consumption by adapting task execution to device battery state, priority, and estimated energy cost.
The project demonstrates how even simple heuristics can significantly change system behavior when energy becomes a first-class constraint.
Problem
Modern software treats energy as an unlimited resource.
In reality, energy consumption directly affects:
device longevity,
carbon footprint,
user experience.
GreenMode explores how task scheduling can become energy-aware, enabling devices to delay, prioritize, or cancel work based on environmental constraints.
