# GreenMode Architecture

GreenMode is structured around three core components:

- BatteryMonitor: collects system energy state  
- TaskManager: manages task queue and execution  
- GreenScheduler: makes energy-aware scheduling decisions  

The system is designed to support future ML-based scheduling and prediction models.
